You need GCC and NASM installed, and the Allegro 4.1.9 programming library headers and libs.



Gens uses the Starcream 680x0 library emulation for the genesis and Sega CD
68000 CPU emulation, the core has been customised and optimised for Gens.

Gens project is structured as follow:



- Gens directory contains all gens sources except the CPU cores.

- Main68k directory contains the sources for the main 68000 (genesis 68000).

- Sub68k directory contains the sources for the sub 68000 (Sega CD 68000).

- z80 directory contains the sources for the Z80 cpu (genesis).



I used 2 68000 cores for speed reasons :


- No context swap required.
- Each core is optimised for its function.



Here's the step to follow to compile succesfully the BeOS vesion of Gens:



- Open the Starscream/Main68k folder and double click on the file named makem68k.sh
- Open the Starscream/Sub68k folder and double click on the file named makes68k.sh

- Open the Gens project and build gens, that's all :)



The gens binary will be available in the gens<version>_bin directory
